# get the last 4 digit of this number:

credit_CardNum = "1987-8943-4562"

print(credit_CardNum[10:])

# Or instead of 10 you can use - numbers :3
# You can use -4 to get the last 4 digits

print(credit_CardNum[-4:])

# Interesting to know about is you can reverse the string by using step (::-1) watch this!

print(credit_CardNum[::-1])

# Like I said previously it can reverse the print statement pretty cool!
